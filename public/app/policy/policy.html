				<h1>Our Policy</h1>
				<p>We believe in the private conversation, the internet is just another part of real life, you can safely walk down the street talking in private without it ever being recorded, so why not online?.</p>
				<p>Perhaps you've got nothing to hide?, would you use an envelope to send a letter? why not just use a post card?</p>
				<p>Our view is basically the same as <a href="https://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html" title="why I wrote PGP">Philip Zimmermann's</a>, we actually use some of his technology.</p>
