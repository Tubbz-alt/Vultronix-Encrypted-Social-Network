				<h1>Shops</h1>
				<p>Shops will soon be under development, all shops will be <strong>100% encrypted</strong>, private and invite only. This privacy will ensure you can only sell with friends who you invite into your shop, you'll never be at risk of having your data dumped online and your granny finding out that you sold her unwanted birthday socks to your interstate Aunt.</p>
				<p>Shops will use <strong>Bitcoin</strong> and have <strong>zero fees</strong>, due to the complete encryption there will be no middleman to complain to. So, it'll be up to users to choose carefully who they invite into their shop, for this reason we recommend you only trade with your good friends.</p>
				<p><i>As with all parts of Vultronix, if you come across illegal activity please report all information you have to your respective law enforcement agency.</i></p>
